Hi! I am a first year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Dr. Swarat Chaudhuri in the Trustworthy & Intelligent Systems Lab. I am interested in neurosymbolic techniques for automated theorem proving and program synthesis.

Research
--------
While in undergrad, I conducted research with the Rutgers Automated Reasoning Lab, being advised by [He Zhu](https://herowanzhu.github.io/). I worked on using differentiable programming for invariant synthesis for program verification. I have also participated in two NSF REUs. The first was remote, but through the College of William & Mary under the advisement of [Charles R. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Royal_Johnson), and working with [Greyson Wesley](https://sites.nd.edu/greyson-wesley/) and Zach Zhao. We studied some topics regarding eigenvalue assignment of certain graphs, and, among other things, proved several results for $k-$NIM trees, including characterization and enumeration. A paper was submitted for publication following our work that summer, and can be viewed [here](/publications). The second was in person at San Diego State University, under the advisement of [Chris O'Neill](https://cdoneill.sdsu.edu/). We studied symmetric numerical semigroups, and more particularly properties of unimaximal faces of the Kunz Cone. We gave a characterization of the facets of these unimaximal faces and constructed some extremal examples of numerical semigroups on these faces.
