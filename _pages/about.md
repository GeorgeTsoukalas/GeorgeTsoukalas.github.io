Hi! I am a first year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Dr. Swarat Chaudhuri, and am interested in neurosymbolic techniques for automated theorem proving.

Projects
--------
I work on personal projects regularly. In the past, I have:
- Developed several indie games, including one which had over 20 million plays, and over 100,000 daily average users consistently. 
- CNNs for Jigsaw Puzzle Solving
- Simulated Annealing for N-Queen problem variant
- Implementation of minimax for an Othello Engine
- a couple others, which can be found [here](/cv)

I am currently working on improving the second and fourth projects listed here. I am also fielding interest for the following project: build a land rover with metal detecting functionality - we will do some signal processing to categorize the detected buried object. I am looking for people with engineering background to start this project with me. Email if interested!

Research
--------
While in undergrad, I conducted research with the Rutgers Automated Reasoning Lab, being advised by [He Zhu](https://herowanzhu.github.io/). I worked on using differentiable programming for invariant synthesis for program verification. I have also participated in two NSF REUs. The first was remote, but through the College of William & Mary under the advisement of [Charles R. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Royal_Johnson), and working with [Greyson Wesley](https://sites.nd.edu/greyson-wesley/) and Zach Zhao. We studied some topics regarding eigenvalue assignment of certain graphs, and, among other things, proved several results for $k-$NIM trees, including characterization and enumeration. A paper was submitted for publication following our work that summer, and can be viewed [here](/publications). The second was in person at San Diego State University, under the advisement of [Chris O'Neill](https://cdoneill.sdsu.edu/). We studied symmetric numerical semigroups, and more particularly properties of unimaximal faces of the Kunz Cone. We gave a characterization of the facets of these unimaximal faces and constructed some extremal examples of numerical semigroups on these faces.

Hobbies
-------
As a hobby, I like to do metal detecting. I've tried my hand at other treasure-finding activites, like [half dollar hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOtxPThNUZI), with less success. I also like to sing and was part of the Rutgers Casual Harmony Acapella Group.
