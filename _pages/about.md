Hi! I am currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University majoring in Math & Computer Science (Honors). I am interested in machine learning theory and applications of novel architectures to problems in automated reasoning. I primarily have a background in mathematics from Rutgers, including graduate coursework in combinatorics and probability theory (as well as others). At the moment, I am reading **Deep Learning Architectures** by Ovidiu Calin to work on the mathematical foundations of current machine learning models, and afterwards I will be beginning to read new research. 

Projects
--------
I work on personal projects regularly. In the past, I have:
- spent some time developing Roblox Games, in particular one which was fairly successful (email me if you want to know more)
- CNNs for Jigsaw Puzzle Solving
- Simulated Annealing for N-Queen type problem, as well as others which can be found [here](URL to projects page)
- Implementation of minimax for an Othello Engine
I am currently working on improving the second and fourth projects listed here.

Research
--------
I have participated in two NSF REUs. The first was remote, but through the College of William & Mary under the advisement of Charles R. Johnson, and working with Greyson Wesley (LINK HERE) and Zach Zhao. We studied some topics regarding eigenvalue assignment of certain graphs, and, among other things, proved several results for $k-$NIM trees. A paper was submitted for publication following our work that summer, and can be viewed [here](PUBLICATION LINK!). The second was in person at San Diego State University, under the advisement of Chris O'Neill. We studied properties of unimaximal faces of the Kunz Cone, and symmetries  At the moment, a [publication](LINK TO PUBLICATIONS) has been submitted as a result of the former program, and of the latter one is in the works. Outside of school-related things, I am into [metal detecting](URL). I used to be big on coin collecting, and tried my hand at [half dollar hunting](URL HERE), though it wasn't successful. I also like to sing and am part of the Rutgers Casual Harmony Acapella Group. Otherwise I like to play basketball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee.
