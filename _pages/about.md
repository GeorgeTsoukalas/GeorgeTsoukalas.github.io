Hi! I am currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University majoring in Math & Computer Science (Honors). I am interested in machine learning theory and applications of novel architectures to problems in automated reasoning. I primarily have a background in mathematics from Rutgers, including graduate coursework in combinatorics and probability theory (as well as others). At the moment, I am reading **Deep Learning Architectures** by Ovidiu Calin to work on the mathematical foundations of current machine learning models, and afterwards I will be beginning to read new research. I have worked on several projects: Roblox game development (send me an email for more information), CNNs for Jigsaw Puzzle Solving, Simulated Annealing for N-Queen type problem, as well as others which can be found [here](URL to projects page). I have participated in two REUs - one in 2021 at William & Mary under the advisement of Charles R. Johnson, and the other this past summer at San Diego State University under the advisement of Chris O'Neill. At the moment, a [publication](LINK TO PUBLICATIONS) has been submitted as a result of the former program, and of the latter one is in the works. Outside of school-related things, I am into [metal detecting](URL). I used to be big on coin collecting, and tried my hand at [half dollar hunting](URL HERE), though it wasn't successful. I also like to sing and am part of the Rutgers Casual Harmony Acapella Group. Otherwise I like to play basketball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee.
