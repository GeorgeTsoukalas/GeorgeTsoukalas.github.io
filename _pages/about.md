Hi! I am currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University majoring in Math & Computer Science (Honors). I am interested in machine learning theory and applications of novel architectures to problems in automated reasoning. I primarily have a background in mathematics from Rutgers, including graduate coursework in combinatorics and probability theory (as well as others). At the moment, I am reading **Deep Learning Architectures** by Ovidiu Calin to work on the mathematical foundations of current machine learning models. After I read this one, I plan to bring myself up to speed to current ML research. Outside of school-related things, I am into [metal detecting](URL). I used to be big on coin collecting, and tried my hand at [half dollar hunting](URL HERE), though it wasn't successful. I also like to sing and am part of the Rutgers Casual Harmony Acapella Group. Otherwise I like to play basketball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee.
