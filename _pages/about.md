Hi! I am a second year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Dr. Swarat Chaudhuri in the Trustworthy & Intelligent Systems Lab. I conduct research in neurosymbolic techniques for automated mathematical reasoning and program synthesis.

Research
--------
Through my second year as a graduate student at UT Austin, I have been involved in two projects broadly falling under the umbrella term "AI for Mathematics." I organized a team of university students to produce a new formal competition maths benchmark for evaluating the next generation of mathematical reasoning automation. [PutnamBench](/publications) was accepted at NeurIPS 2024 and recognized at the ICML 2024 AI for Math Workshop via the [Best Paper Award](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4mathworkshopicml2024/awards?authuser=0). I also contributed to [COPRA](/publications), an agentic LLM-based approach for formal theorem-proving.

While in undergrad, I conducted research with the Rutgers Automated Reasoning Lab, being advised by [He Zhu](https://herowanzhu.github.io/). I worked on using differentiable programming for invariant synthesis for program verification. Before conducting computer science research, I was involved in research in theoretical maths. I participated in an NSF REU at the College of William & Mary under the advisement of [Charles R. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Royal_Johnson), and working with [Greyson Wesley](https://sites.nd.edu/greyson-wesley/) and Zach Zhao. We studied some topics regarding eigenvalue assignment of certain graphs, and, among other things, proved several results for $k-$NIM trees, including characterization and enumeration. We submitted a [paper](/publications) following the conclusion of the REU based on the results we showed. The second was in person at San Diego State University, under the advisement of [Chris O'Neill](https://cdoneill.sdsu.edu/). We studied symmetric numerical semigroups, and more particularly properties of unimaximal faces of the Kunz Cone. We gave a characterization of the facets of these unimaximal faces and constructed some extremal examples of numerical semigroups on these faces.
