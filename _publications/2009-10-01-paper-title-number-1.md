title: "$k$-NIM Trees: Characterization and Enumeration"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-kNIM
excerpt: 'Among those real symmetric matrices whose graph is a given tree T, the maximum multiplicity $M(T)$ that can be attained by an eigenvalue is known to be the path cover number of $T$. We say that a tree is $k$-NIM if, whenever an eigenvalue attains a multiplicity of $k − 1$ less
than the maximum multiplicity, all other multiplicities are 1. $1$-NIM trees are known as NIM
trees, and a characterization for NIM trees is already known. Here we provide a graph-theoretic
characterization for $k$-NIM trees for each k ≥ 1, as well as count them. It follows from the
characterization that k-NIM trees exist on n vertices only when $k = 1, 2, 3$. In case k = 3, the
only 3-NIM trees are simple stars.'
